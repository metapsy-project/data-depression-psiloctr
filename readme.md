## **The `data-depression-psiloctr` dataset** ðŸ“Š 

The `data-depression-psiloctr` dataset is a meta-analytic research domain ([MARD](https://docs.metapsy.org/uploads/ebmental-2022-300509.pdf)) 
on psilocybin-assisted therapies for adults with depressive symptoms. 
This MARD is part of the  [Metapsy project](https://www.metapsy.org/). 
The date of the last search update is provided [here](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-depression-psiloctr/blob/master/metadata/last_search.txt). 
This dataset includes **psilocybin-assisted therapy vs. control ('psy vs ctr')** comparisons. Effect sizes are provided for outcomes at post-test and long-term follow-ups, if available. 

This living database has been developed by the [**Sypres**](https://sypres.io/) (Synthesis of Psychedelic Research Studies) Collaboration. Further information on Sypres and its underlying methodology can be found in this  [published article](https://doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2025.2495950).

The dataset follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/). All included information has been independently extracted two researchers. Risk of bias ratings were conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool (Version 2).
